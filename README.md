### Key Features üî•

- **Multi-Agent Memory System:** Six specialized memory components (Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource, Knowledge Vault) managed by dedicated agents
- **Screen Activity Tracking:** Continuous visual data capture and intelligent consolidation into structured memories  
- **Privacy-First Design:** All long-term data stored locally with user-controlled privacy settings
- **Advanced Search:** PostgreSQL-native BM25 full-text search with vector similarity support
- **Multi-Modal Input:** Text, images, voice, and screen captures processed seamlessly

### Build the App from the source code
First set up a clean python environment:
```
# Create a clean virtual environment (recommended to avoid dependency conflicts)
python -m venv mirix_env

# Activate the environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source mirix_env/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# mirix_env\Scripts\activate
```

Then install dependencies:
```
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install PyInstaller in the clean environment
pip install pyinstaller

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

Then build the backend and desktop app:
```
# Make sure you're in the clean environment
source mirix_env/bin/activate

# Build the backend executable
pyinstaller main.spec --clean

# Build the complete desktop application
cd frontend
npm run electron-pack
```

This will create a self-contained desktop application with:
- Embedded PGlite database (no external PostgreSQL needed)
- Pre-built Python backend executable
- React frontend in Electron wrapper

The final application will be available in `frontend/dist/`.
